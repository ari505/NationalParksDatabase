        <h2>Welcome to the National Park Database!</h2>
        <p id="welcomeMessage">This database keeps 
            track of reservations made at Yosemite National Park and is meant to increase 
            efficiency to park employees in managing reservations, and by extension, 
            make park resources more accessible to the public. The database allows for the following functionality:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>View and Add New Campgrounds</li>
                <li>Add, Update, and Delete Reservations</li>
                <li>View and Add New Employees</li>
                <li>View and Add New Participants</li>
                <li>View and Add New Programs</li>
                <li>View Reservation/Participant Information</li>
