        This database keeps track of reservations made at Yosemite National Park and is meant to increase 
        efficiency to park employees in managing reservations, and by extension, make park resources more 
        accessible to the public. Parks have access to participant, employee, program, campground, and reservation 
        data. Employees can make reservations for registered participants. Participant profiles include their full 
        name, age and relevant contact information to determine program eligibility and also maintain open communication.
