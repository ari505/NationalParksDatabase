All code is based on CS340 starter code with the exception of: 
    -DDL.sql 
    -DML.sql 
    -all files in the "front-end" folder
    -style.cc and all relevant html code in .hbs files
    -index.hbs
    -deleteConfirm() function in reservations.hbs 
        {{!-- Citation for deleteConfirm():
        Date: 6/6/24
        Adapted from: delete function at the given link

    -confirm() function in all add files 
        // Citation for confirm():
        // Date: 6/6/24
        // Adapted from: confirm alert function at the given link 
        // Source URL: https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_confirm.asp

All of the logic involved, especially with the Reservation/Reservation_has_Participants (M:N) INSERTS and UPDATES in app.js, is original work
